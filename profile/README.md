# Experimental Source Laboratory at Recap Time Squad

## Welcome to the lab!

This is where we incubate experimental projects and create a sandbox for future projects before committing to the bit
and set up its own infrastructure within Recap Time Squad's namespaces. We're currently ironing out the details to
follow the [CNCF model](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/project_proposals.md) on this.

## Should my project go here?

For instructions, [see the `recaptime-repo-transitioner` namespace README](https://github.com/recaptime-repo-transitioner/.github/edit/main/profile/README.md)
for details.
