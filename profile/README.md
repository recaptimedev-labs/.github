# Welcome to the labs at RecapTime.dev!

This is where we incubate experimental projects and create a sandbox for future projects as an incubator before
committing to the bit and setting up their infrastructure within Recap Time Squad's namespaces. We're currently
ironing out the details to follow the [CNCF model][cncf] on this.

## Should my project go here?

For instructions, [see the `recaptimedev-repo-transitioner` namespace README][repo-transitioner] on GitHub for details.

For GitLab users, we use GitLab SaaS (aka the official `GitLab.com` instance)
